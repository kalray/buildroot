	  Enabling this option will compile and install the libc-test suite.
	  libc-test is a libc-agnostic test suite for standard C libraries.
	  libc-test is also the official test suite for the musl libc.

	  The test suite will be installed into
	  /usr/lib/libc-test directory. To run the test suite
	  enter the /usr/lib/libc-test/ directory and type
	  "make run".

	  See /usr/lib/libc-test/README for additional
	  information.

	  This is not needed at all for normal builds, so you can
	  safely say no if you do not plan to dig into your C library.
